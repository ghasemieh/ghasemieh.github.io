## My Recent Open-Source Projects on GitHub

### - [Duplicate Bug Report Detection System](https://ghasemieh.github.io/Duplicated-Bug-Report-Detection-System/)
This project aims to propose an effective unsupervised and supervised models to detect duplicate bug report in the Bugzilla repository. The search engine finds the top-N most similar reports to a given report, and deduplicate issues faster. Moreover, it presents an analytical dashboard to developers to understand the different aspects of the bug reportsâ€™ statistics and major sources of bug generation.

### - [Default Risk Modeling](https://github.com/ghasemieh/Default-Risk-Modeling)
This project aims to build a Default Risk predictive model to assess the credibility of loan applicants.
